# Cerberus

## Description
---
- What is Cerberus?
	- Cerberus is a local password manager for users to circumvent the security risks presented w/ privatized password management companies

- Who is Cerberus for?
	- Easy answer, me; however, Cerberus is friendly to any clients capable of running a python script.
	- **NOTE:** V1 is **not** user friendly, V2 is **much more** user friendly

## Stack
---
- Python

## Other Info
---
- Uses an encryption library to encrypt pass and key files
- Hosted solely on the client machine
	- In more important terms, there is no server storage to keep the user secure. Who better to host your passwords than yourself?

## Disclaimer
---
- Obviously this is far from a perfect tool, and it is **not** necessarily 100% secure (nothing is), but the chance to bring better password security to users is one I wanna try and take! Please, enjoy your experience w/ Cerberus if you do explore this code, and maybe consider him a new friend for your password storage and security.
- For transparancy, the source code is present here. The entire program runs purely in the client's own system with solely their own input information- no other data necessary!

## Versions
---
Cerberus V1:
	- The first in the Cerberus line of password management
	- Runs barebones Python w/ minimal error checking (this version was originally just to be my own)
Cerberus V2:
	- Cerberus has dug himself out from the depths and is ready to try and assit you in guarding your precious passwords
	- Now w/ pass and key file ext functionallity built in, users now enter the name rather than the path
	- Error handling improvements and additions
Cerberus V3 (WIP):
	- Introducing the new head of Cerberus, this one with a GUI through tkinter!
	- Meet the GUI-based Cerberus version, a WIP that will soon bring more usability and accessibilty to Cerberus
	- Again, a **WIP**, no bugs nor issues will be considered for this version, nor am I responsible for any damage you may incur as a result of using this unstable version; you have been warned!
