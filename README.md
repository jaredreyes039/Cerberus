# Cerberus

## Description
- What is Cerberus?
	- Cerberus is a local password manager for users to circumvent the security risks presented w/ privatized password management companies

- Who is Cerberus for?
	- Originally, I was planning on just using Cerberus for myself, but I figure others could make use of a quirky, self-hosted password manager. Despite amazing movements in FOSS password management and security, I am a rather paranoid individual when it comes to my personal privacy and security.

	Simply put, Cerberus is not a perfect solution to password privacy, there isn't one, and there never will be one, but if you find use in Cerberus, then I am grateful for the chance to serve you a simple, efficient bit of script. 

	Obviously, I am not alone in making something like this, and it is fairly common to see personal password managers, but I couldn't find one that had both simplicity, clarity, and theming. That said, I hope the quirky Pagan theming will at least make you chuckle as you take back control of your privacy like a demigod!

	For suggestions, bug reports, and other topics of discussion, please open and issue, and let's unravel the power that may be in the currently mediocre strength of Cerberus!

## Stack
- Python

## Other Info
- Uses an encryption library to encrypt pass and key files
- Hosted solely on the client machine
	- In more important terms, there is no server storage to keep the user secure. Who better to host your passwords than yourself?

## Disclaimer
- **Your** passwords are **your** passwords, and Cerberus is not responsible for mismanagement, mishandling, or accidental/intentional removal of any password or key file data, nor the consequences that could insue. As I stated in the description, there is **no** perfect solution to password security, but bringing it to your local machine is an excellnt start. Move away from servers, move away from companies, and question the strength of FOSS alternatives (no hate on FOSS, but there is undoubtedly a sense of ambiguity as to where your data is stored, and managed). 

- For transparancy, the source code is present here. The entire program runs purely in the client's own system with solely their own input information- no other data necessary!

- **WARNING**: I feel this should go unsaid, but to make it clear- if you are victim to a RCE-attack, or other data leak from your personal file system, then your passwords could be stolen. Be smart, be safe, and be persistent in maintaining your personal security! I support you in it all!
